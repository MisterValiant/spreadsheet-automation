## ‚úíÔ∏è General Information 
learn-python contains beginner-friendly exercises and solutions from the tutorial by [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc "Tutorial"). It is an effort to understand the language from the basics in order to master more advanced stuff such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Web Scraping, and so on.

Additionally, it also forms part of my university course, AI & Machine Learning.
